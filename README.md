### Description

This project will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best algorithm from preliminary results will be further optimized for the best model of the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  

### Project Goals
- **Target: Which potential donors make over $50,000?**
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem
